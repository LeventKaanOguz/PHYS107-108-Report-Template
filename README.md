# Report Format Template for PHYS107&108 Courses at METU

## Introduction

I started writing my reports in $\LaTeX$ from the very beginning of the PHYS107 course. However, I realized some of my friends were struggling with writing their reports with MS Word, which is the most popular "word" editor of our time. In this repository, you can find a report template, I try to continuously update with the newer report format. 

## How to Use This Repo?

- You can see the happy green button that says `<> Code`, just click on that and either clone the repository using git tool, or download the zip file and decompress it.
- Sign up/in to [Overleaf](overleaf.com), this website provides you necessary $\LaTeX$ tools and also allows you to write reports with friends or collegues. Create a "Blank Project", then upload everything from the downloaded folder, *not from the zip file*, and continue with below steps.
- Check `examples.tex` file to understand basics of $\LaTeX$ with some examples I have created. When it is open at your screen, just click the big green button that says "Compile". You will most probably need all the examples from this file in, almost, every report you are writing.
- If you are finished, remove all files *except* `main.tex`, this file will be your report format template. 
- **If you get stuck with anything, use Google. I am no expert of either LaTeX or report writing.**

- If you want something to change, get added, or removed, create a poll request or send me a mail with your request/inquiry. (My email is [l.kaanoguz@gmail.com](mailto:l.kaanoguz@gmail.com))


## Known Bugs & Acknowledgements
- If you see a line that includes `\setcounter...` remove or comment it out (you can comment a line with using % before the part you want to comment), it is problematic and your references may not work.
- References *MUST* be in `references.bib` file in appropriate format, you can check it from internet (most of the time you can find already existing or transform it)
- Do not forget to add your signature as `image.png` inside of `images` folder and make necessary size adjustments.
- I am too lazy to organize my files, will do that in a later day.
